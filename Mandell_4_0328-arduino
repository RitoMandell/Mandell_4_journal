Some similarities I have noticed with the arduino's is that you write it in a similar way in which you would with Java, using various data types including int; however, a difference I have noticed is the lack of main in the code which is a what is needed in Java. One final similarity I noticed is how the code uses if statments to run effectivly and do what the program is asking of it to operate.
So far I haven't done or had to do anything new or make an adaption besides that of not writing main at the beginning of the code.
For a circuit to run you need a power source (voltage), usually you need some sort of resistor, and then you also need it to be connect fully so that electricity may fully run through it to create a complete circuit.
The methods and classes have already been defined some where else or it does not need to be defined to run properly and be complied.
So far my partner and I have completed a few projects ranging from making a light blink on it's own, to pushing a button, to multi-color LED.
So far I have not thought of what the projects may be; however, I would like to do something with the muli-color LED, and probably a button because everyone deep down just wants to push a button.
