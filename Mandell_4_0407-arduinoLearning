From the use of arduinos I have learned that importance of throughly reading the code before you begin working with it. While using the original template of the sound project, I had been changing a variable that was supposed to be a rest, but I read the code wrong and assumed that it was where I should be entering variables. This created and emitted a high pitched screeched that I later solved by reading through the code and code comments to understand the problem. Another thing I have learned from the use of arduinos is how to address a problem, and deal with it quickly. This had previously been a huge problem I had faced but with the use of arduinos I have learned how to be more carfull coding to ensure no errors were created. This can be used in all CS languages and will be very vital later. Finally the biggest thing I learned from the arduinos is how to tinker. No other project has let me tinker or learn more than the arduino project so I have learned how to test things and tinker. This again can be used in all CS problems but is incredibly important for arduino projects.
