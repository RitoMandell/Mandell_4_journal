I could have come in to work on my game more often and I could have tried to use a tile set that wasn't too large in which the computer couldn't handle it.
My process for problem solving/trouble shooting was I identified there was a problem (either through it showing up as red, or the game wouldn't run), then I would read the error message and where the error was. If it was a simple fix or grammar based mistake I would fix it then continue to ensure the problem was resolved. However if it was a problem I could not fix on my own easily, I would go around the code looking at the example to try and fix it, if that didn't work I would try and look online for a resolution to the problem. If all that failed and I still was unable to resolve the problem I would then go to Mr.Davis for help.
