Students are encouraged to learn CS for two reasons, first being that CS fundementals are based upon anilitical thinking and processing information in order to solve and put things together that you otherwise wouldn't be able to do or struggle significantly with. The second reason that students are encouraged to learn CS is in order to be influenced by it and consider a job in the CS field, that is otherwise understaffed in the United States, and thus if students are learning CS and wanting to go into the field we could see a better US economy.
Students should be learning from CS how to approach problems in different ways and begin thinking further on how things work, and what makes them work. This in turn allows students to solve problems and be better off in most situations. The students should also be learning the basics of CS, including how to program and code.
