I was almost able to meet the timeline completly however in the end I was unable to finish on the deadline, I was unable to finish the game due to the problems I encountered with implementing my map. This is still taking a long time to fix as the way to fix it is slow or that it changes the map to something I did not intend.
I worked on the project outside of class time a little. I came into work on it on a couple occassions during long-period or during first period once or twice.
