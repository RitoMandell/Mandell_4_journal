I will use methods to create the flow of the game, almost everything will be a method honestly, I am doing this so that it is as controlled as possible and that I can make EXACTLY what I want to happen, happen but specifically I will be using a method for the choices of the player and then identifying their choices.
The values I will be passing on throught the methods will be the choice of the player, and then the text that will occur, also the lose condition is passed throught the code seeing if it becomes true, specifaclly whether or not the have gotten the key in the game or not.
