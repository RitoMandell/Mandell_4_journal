So far we have coded what we want to use from the tetris theme song, and we have now started to work on the frogger theme music.
We have used the template for music, changed letters, and changed frequincies, and then continued to use this to put together the first few bars of the tetris theme music.
Continue to code various theme musics, while also figuring out how to make it where you can call upon each one indivually. Also I will want to assess and deal with a problem in which I can only use 18 beats for the buzzer to not emit a high pitched screech permantly.
I will be able to present a couple of games' theme music (most likly 3-4 if all goes well).
I am changing variables while also adding some of my own. We are using the base template however for the sake of efficiency and to be able to just start.
So far none; however, eventually we will begin to create a function calling upon sound files from a button press.
