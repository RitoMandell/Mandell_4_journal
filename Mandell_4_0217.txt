You use arrays to create the map and blocked.
private int[] coolarray = new int{1};
private String[] superarrary = new String{"hi"};
private boolean greatarray = new boolean{true}; 
private double[] anotherarray = new double{.01};
private int[] coolarray = new int{42};
private String[] andanother array = new String{"bob"}
Creates a new int array with a value of 3
This creates a new string array with rice pudding, pan dulce, and bunuelos as the values.
One is a int array that can only hold whole numbers while the other can hold, essentially, any value.
You would go into the code and take out bunuelos and then add apple pie to where bunuelos was.
