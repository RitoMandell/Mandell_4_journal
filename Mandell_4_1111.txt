THe challenges the player must solve is who to deal with the situations they are put into, and later get out of an evil lair.
This, luckily, if very easy to solve as, as long as they have made the "correct" choices the game will continue, and if not it's game over (or another ending).
Userinput, (no classes to name as there are none).
