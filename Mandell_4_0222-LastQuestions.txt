We will have a test on Friday.
It will be about the notes from last week.
Are you ready? 
Sure?
What specific questions do you have about the Slick Game?
No specific questions over specific things.
We will be revising our Slick game to:
1. Have multiple levels
2. Enemies
3. Traps (or something) with coordinates defined by an array.
4. Give and take damage
5. Score
6. Inventory or some compelling alternative.
What will you have to do to get this working?
Fix my game to make it where it can run properly, and then implement these new things.
Are you prepared? Do you have all knowledge you need? 
If not be specific. 
I think I am prepared mostly, I just need to implement this in a working way.
