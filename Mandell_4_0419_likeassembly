The similarities I notice between HMR and assembly is that both you incredibly similar commands and capabilities to operate and work, and both work with an input output type, in a linear format.
The differences between the two focus on how assembly is significantly more complicated and intrecate in what you can do, as well as it is harder to write and create as it is not the "drag and drop programming" HMR uses.
