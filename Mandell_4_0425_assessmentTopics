I believe the 10 concepts we will conver in the test will be:
What object oriented programing is, and examples of it.
Steps for problem solving and what to do when you face a challenge.
Differences in programming languages.
Java questions about methods.
Data types questions
Array and Arraylist
Questions about assembly and low level programming
Java questions about if statments
Correct java coding "grammar"
Questions about Linux commands and operations.
These topics will be covered because we covered all of these for longer periods of time throughtout the year and we practice the majority of these each day and thus we should know all of these by know and their importance to CS.
