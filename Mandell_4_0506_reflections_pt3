if (i=0){ System.out.print("8888"); -This enters the number 8888, if i = 0
System.out.print(map[i][j]); -This prints out the map into the output
System.out.println("."); -This puts in a "." whenever the value isn't x and this is different than #e because #c creates a new line of code hense println instead of print in #e
System.out.println(map[i][j]); -this prints out the map and finishes the code together
